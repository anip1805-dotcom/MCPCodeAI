# Professional Development Skills & Best Practices

## Core Development Skills

### 1. Problem Decomposition
**Breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces**

- Start with the big picture, then break into smaller components
- Identify dependencies between components
- Create a clear execution plan
- Tackle one piece at a time
- Validate each piece before moving forward

**Example Approach:**
```
Large Feature → Components → Functions → Implementation
```

### 2. Debugging Methodology
**Systematic approach to finding and fixing bugs**

#### The Scientific Method
1. **Reproduce**: Confirm the bug consistently occurs
2. **Isolate**: Narrow down where the problem occurs
3. **Hypothesize**: Form theories about the cause
4. **Test**: Verify or disprove each hypothesis
5. **Fix**: Implement the solution
6. **Verify**: Ensure the fix works and doesn't break anything else

#### Debugging Tools
- Print/console statements for quick insights
- Debugger breakpoints for step-through analysis
- Logging for production debugging
- Stack traces for error context
- Unit tests to isolate issues

### 3. Code Reading & Understanding
**Effectively understanding existing codebases**

#### Steps to Understand New Code
1. Read the README and documentation first
2. Understand the project structure and architecture
3. Identify the entry point (main.py, index.js, etc.)
4. Follow the flow of a typical request/operation
5. Look for patterns and conventions
6. Note dependencies and external services

#### Questions to Ask
- What problem does this code solve?
- What are the main components?
- How do components interact?
- What are the data flows?
- Where are the external dependencies?

### 4. Refactoring Skills
**Improving code without changing functionality**

#### When to Refactor
- Code duplication (DRY violation)
- Functions longer than ~50 lines
- Deeply nested conditionals
- Poor naming or unclear intent
- Performance bottlenecks
- Before adding new features

#### Safe Refactoring Steps
1. Ensure tests exist (write them if needed)
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Run tests after each change
4. Commit working states frequently
5. Use IDE refactoring tools when available

#### Common Refactoring Patterns
- Extract method/function
- Rename for clarity
- Extract class/module
- Simplify conditionals
- Remove dead code

### 5. API Design Skills
**Creating clean, intuitive interfaces**

#### RESTful API Design
```
GET    /users          # List users
GET    /users/:id      # Get specific user
POST   /users          # Create user
PUT    /users/:id      # Update user
DELETE /users/:id      # Delete user
```

#### Good API Characteristics
- **Consistent**: Predictable patterns across endpoints
- **Intuitive**: Easy to understand without extensive docs
- **Versioned**: Can evolve without breaking clients
- **Well-documented**: Clear examples and descriptions
- **Error-friendly**: Meaningful error messages

### 6. Database Design Skills
**Structuring data effectively**

#### Key Principles
- Normalize to reduce redundancy
- Index frequently queried fields
- Use appropriate data types
- Consider query patterns when designing
- Plan for scalability

#### Common Patterns
```sql
-- One-to-Many
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE posts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    content TEXT
);

-- Many-to-Many
CREATE TABLE users_roles (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    role_id INTEGER REFERENCES roles(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_id)
);
```

### 7. Testing Skills
**Writing effective tests**

#### Test Pyramid
```
      /\
     /UI\         Few - Slow - Expensive
    /____\
   /Integ-\       Medium number
  /ration \
 /__________\
/   Unit     \    Many - Fast - Cheap
/______________\
```

#### Good Test Characteristics
- **Independent**: Tests don't depend on each other
- **Repeatable**: Same results every time
- **Fast**: Quick feedback loop
- **Comprehensive**: Cover edge cases
- **Readable**: Clear what's being tested

#### Test Structure (Arrange-Act-Assert)
```python
def test_user_creation():
    # Arrange
    username = "testuser"
    email = "test@example.com"
    
    # Act
    user = create_user(username, email)
    
    # Assert
    assert user.username == username
    assert user.email == email
    assert user.id is not None
```

### 8. Security Awareness
**Building secure applications**

#### Key Security Principles
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
- **Fail Securely**: Default to denying access
- **Never Trust Input**: Validate and sanitize everything
- **Keep Secrets Secret**: Use environment variables and vaults

#### Common Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
1. Injection (SQL, Command, etc.)
2. Broken Authentication
3. Sensitive Data Exposure
4. XML External Entities (XXE)
5. Broken Access Control
6. Security Misconfiguration
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

### 9. Performance Optimization
**Making applications fast and efficient**

#### Optimization Strategy
1. **Measure First**: Profile before optimizing
2. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Focus on the slowest parts
3. **Optimize Smartly**: Target high-impact areas
4. **Measure Again**: Verify improvements
5. **Consider Trade-offs**: Balance speed, memory, complexity

#### Common Optimizations
- Database query optimization (indexes, query structure)
- Caching (Redis, in-memory, CDN)
- Lazy loading and pagination
- Async/parallel processing
- Code-level optimizations (algorithms, data structures)

### 10. Documentation Skills
**Communicating through code and docs**

#### Code Documentation
```python
def calculate_discount(price: float, discount_percent: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the discounted price.
    
    Args:
        price: Original price before discount
        discount_percent: Discount percentage (0-100)
    
    Returns:
        Final price after applying discount
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If discount_percent is not between 0 and 100
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_discount(100.0, 20.0)
        80.0
    """
    if not 0 <= discount_percent <= 100:
        raise ValueError("Discount must be between 0 and 100")
    return price * (1 - discount_percent / 100)
```
